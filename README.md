## Evaluation
We release our synthetic testing dataset (**[CelebA_LQ_syn](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T2Wor0KXbdZkod8YvoSKOkQCZHXXAiPq)**) and restoration results of CelebA-Test, LFW-Test, Wider-Test, WebPhoto-Test (**[ours](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T2Wor0KXbdZkod8YvoSKOkQCZHXXAiPq)**).

Also, we provide data(**[CelebA_LQ_realesrgan_syn](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T2Wor0KXbdZkod8YvoSKOkQCZHXXAiPq)**) & restoration results(**[Ours_RESR](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T2Wor0KXbdZkod8YvoSKOkQCZHXXAiPq)**) of a synthetic dataset with [RealESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN.git) degradation.
